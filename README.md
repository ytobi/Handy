# handy
A generic header-only data structure library for enthusiasts.

This library of common data structure, functions, "services" and more, is meant to serve and fill immediate of code/programs/projects
that require them.

It is often common to be in need of simple data structure to serve an immediate purpose/need, without the need to expend or
compile/build external code and programs in your code. Handy will come in "handy" during this times.

Handy is header-only, that implies can easily include, copied to in your project, code etc and is generic, hence will permit
working and manipulating data of all types.

Feel free to contribute to making handy as complete as it needs to be.

Sure there are issues with current development, fell free to report them by raising an issue.
